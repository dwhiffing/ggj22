Gameplay
  enemies should spawn more frequently
  player should level up faster (level 20 by 6/7 minutes)
  better spawning logic so groups of enemies spawn and swarm from random directions
    should spawn a large enemy with a bunch of smaller enemies around it
    should try to ensure that the level is always full of enemies
    spawn a bunch of weak enemies while you are transformed
    idea: make circle in random position found by spawn, and instead find a bunch of random positions within it
      ensure none of those positions are within n distance of eachother
      place big monster in center
      place smaller monsters all around

  work on enemy/weapon balance
  spawner needs to have 2 groups of enemies: colliders and non-colliders.  Stats determine if you collide with other enemies
  small skull should shoot different shots than big skull?
  make slimes hop around
  make gremlins run to random spots near the player instead of directly toward him
  add dodge roll?
  add bosses after certain amount of kills/time?
  dropped powerups?
