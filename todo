save after level up
allow big guy to push enemies around and take basically no damage
add ai/variants to enemy constants, skull ai should be "flying" instead
add new skull art and split into small/big skull
skull gun should make different noise
use different death sounds for different enemies
use different material sounds for different enemy impacts
spawn a bunch of weak enemies while you are transformed
make slimes hop around
make gremlins run to random spots near the player instead of directly toward him


better UI: pixel font, better bars and buttons
add instructions
polish audio (probably fewer bullet impact sounds)
skulls need to not collide with enemies

work on enemy/weapon balance
better spawning logic so groups of enemies spawn and swarm from random directions
  ( should spawn a large enemy with a bunch of smaller enemies around it)
  ( should try to ensure that the level is always full of enemies)
  idea: make circle in random position found by spawn, and instead find a bunch of random positions within it
  ensure none of those positions are within n distance of eachother
  place big monster in center
  place smaller monsters all around

menu title art
menu/score background
better gun art
add bullet trails effects for weapons
Better weapon names/icons/descriptions
UI indicating current weapons/upgrades
gremlins need own ai?

mobile controls
bug where shotgun doesn't aim at pointer
