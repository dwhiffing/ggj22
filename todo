MUST:
spawner needs to have 2 groups of enemies: colliders and non-colliders.  Stats determine if you collide with other enemies
playtest with audio
clean up unused sounds
work on weapon/upgrade/enemy balance

NICE:
UI indicating current weapons/upgrades (use bullet art as icons for shop and ui for current upgrades)
better score screen (should show if you topped your own score)
use different death sounds for different enemies
use different material sounds for different enemy impacts
pixel font
better bars

PROBABLY NOT:
blast based on purchased weapons
better gun art
add bullet trails effects for weapons
menu/score background/better buttons/better menu title art
mobile controls
