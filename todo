MUST:
spawner needs to have multiple groups of enemies:
  flyers
  small slimes?
  everything else

instead of random positions, spawner should put enemies int he most empty region
instead of random types, spawner should try to reach specific distributions
health orbs follow you on pick up

work on weapon/upgrade/enemy balance

UI indicating current weapons/upgrades (use bullet art as icons for shop and ui for current upgrades)


playtest with audio
clean up unused sounds
use different death sounds for different enemies
use different material sounds for different enemy impacts

PROBABLY NOT:
blast based on purchased weapons
better gun art
add bullet trails effects for weapons
menu/score background
better title art
mobile controls
